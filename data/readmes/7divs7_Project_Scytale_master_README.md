https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05290

With the advent of quantum computing, and other advancements in computation and processing capabilities of modern systems,
there arises a need to develop new trapdoor functions that will serve as the foundation for a new generation of encryption schemes. This
paper explores the possibility of one such potential trapdoor function using concepts stemming from Reversible Cellular Automata (RCA)
specifically, the Critter’s Rule set up in a Margolus Neighborhood. The proposed block encryption algorithm discusses how sensitive data
can be manipulated and converted efficiently into a two dimensional sequence of bits, that can be iteratively evolved using the rules of the
RCA and a private key to achieve a desirable level of encryption within a reasonable runtime. The performance benchmark and analysis
results exemplify how well the proposed encryption algorithm stands against different forms of attacks.
