# CONPRAS
CONvex PRocedure for Augmented Sparsity - This program implements the structured robust stabilization technique, based upon the Network Realization Function framework, to synthesize distributed and robustly stabilizing controllers whose sparsity structure may not be feasible, when employing the system's nominal model.

The procedure is in its prototype stage and, currently, only a demo is provided, in order to highlight the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05954).
