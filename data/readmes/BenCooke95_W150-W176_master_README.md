https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06622

Included are the WASP photomety, follow-up spectroscopy and follow-up photometry.

Data files are named by instrument and date (where applicable). Dates follow the ddmmyyyy convention. TRAPPIST data is split into a (before meridian flip) and b (after meridian flip).

The photometry files each contain 3 columns: HJD(-2450000), Flux, Flux_err

The spectroscopy files each contain 5 columns: HJD(-2450000), RV(km/s), RV_err(km/s), BIS(km/s), BIS_err(km/s)
