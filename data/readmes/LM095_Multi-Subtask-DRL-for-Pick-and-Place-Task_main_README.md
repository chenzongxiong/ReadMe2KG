## Abstract
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising approach to generate adaptive behaviors for robotic platforms. However, a major drawback of using DRL is the data-hungry training regime that requires millions of trial and error attempts, which is impractical when running experiments on robotic systems. Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) has been introduced to solve this issue by cloning the behavior of expert demonstrations. However, LfD requires a large number of demonstrations that are difficult to be acquired since dedicated complex setups are required.To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-subtask reinforcement learning methodology where complex pick and place tasks can be decomposed into low-level subtasks. These subtasks are parametrized as expert networks and learned via DRL methods. Trained subtasks are then combined by a high-level choreographer to accomplish the intended pick and place task considering different initial configurations. As a testbed, we use a pick and place robotic simulator to demonstrate our methodology and show that our method outperforms a benchmark methodology based on LfD in terms of sample-efficiency.We transfer the learned policy to the real robotic system and demonstrate robust grasping using various geometric-shaped objects. 


## Implementation details
### Prerequisites
- Python3.7+
- PyTorch==1.0.0
- mpi4py
- OpenAI gym==0.17.1 (base with some changes)
- OpenAI gym==0.10.8 (base with some changes in the action space)
- mujoco physics engine

Here, we used the OpenAI simulator *FetchPickandPlace-v1* which provides a kinematic state vector as an input to our network.
For installing OpenAI fetch simulator: refer to [Fetch](https://openai.com/blog/ingredients-for-robotics-research/)

Since a hierarchical task decomposition is used, there are two different goals during the same episode: one is the final goal of the whole episode, which is where to place the block, and the other one changes based on which subtask we want to train.

In order to use a dense reward and obtain good results, we modified the original OpenAI gym's *step* function, which determines for each action perform to the environment, the next state, the reward obtained for that action, and if we reach the episode goal.
Basically our new *env.step()* function now requires two parameters, the action to be taken in the environment (as before), but also what is the goal that the agent is trying to achieve.
In case of approach, the goal will be a position slightly above the block as mentioned before, for manipulate will be the base of the object to grasp, and finally for retract the goal will be the point where we want to place the object

If you want train the agent with our method you need to replace the base gym with the gym in this repository: `Multi-Subtask-DRL-for-Pick-and-Place-Task/gymModified`

### Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/LM095/Multi-Subtask-DRL-for-Pick-and-Place-Task
cd Multi-Subtask-DRL-for-Pick-and-Place-Task
```
### Step 0: Train e2e and BC
For a good end-to-end implementation of DDPG+HER PyTorch implementation you can refer to this repository: https://github.com/TianhongDai/hindsight-experience-replay

For the subtask approach with imitation learning method (BC) check this repo:
https://github.com/cvas-ug/simple-reactive-nn


### Step 1: Train the Low-level Subtask Expert (LSE) 

![](images/allTrainingProc.png)

- Use Gym==0.17.1 modified.
- replace your original gym folder with the one present in this repository. Usually, if you are using anaconda you can find your gym at this path:
```
~/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym
```
- rename your gym folder to whatever name you prefer and place the new gym folder copied from this repository and change the name from "gymModified" to "gym".
- For all the subtasks training you can stop the training after two consecutive high success rate. For the plot reported in the results section, we stopped approach training after 9 epochs, manipulate after 2 epochs and retract after 6 epochs.

#### Train Approach LSE 
- Go to the folder named "fetchPickAndPlace-DDPG+HER"
- Go to the folder named 'rl_modules' and change the name "ddpg_agent_approach.py" into "ddpg_agent.py"
- Go back to "fetchPickAndPlace-DDPG+HER"  folder and run the program:
```
mpirun -np 1 python -u train.py --env-name='FetchPickAndPlace-v1' 2>&1 | tee pick.log
```

#### Train Manipulate LSE 
- Go to the folder named 'rl_modules' in the cloned directory and change the name "ddpg_agent.py" in "ddpg_agent_approach" and "ddpg_agent_manipulate.py" into "ddpg_agent.py"
- Go back to "FetchPickAndPlace-DDPG+HER"  folder and run the program:
```
mpirun -np 1 python -u train.py --env-name='FetchPickAndPlace-v1' 2>&1 | tee pick.log
```

#### Train Retract LSE 
- Go to the folder named 'rl_modules' in the cloned directory and change the name "ddpg_agent.py" in "ddpg_agent_manipulate" and "ddpg_agent_retract.py" into "ddpg_agent.py"
- Go back to "FetchPickAndPlace-DDPG+HER"  folder and run the program:
```
mpirun -np 1 python -u train.py --env-name='FetchPickAndPlace-v1' 2>&1 | tee pick.log
```





## Train the High-Level Choreographer (HLC):
- Use Gym==0.10.8 modified (gymHLC).
- replace your original gym folder with the one present in this repository. Usually, if you are using anaconda you can find your gym at this path:
```
~/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gym
```
- rename your gym folder to whatever name you prefer and place the new gym folder copied from this repository and change the name from "gymHLC" to "gym".
- In the "init Weights" folder there are some weights collected from BC subtasks training. If you want to test HLC with BC methods, copy the file in the "initWeights" folder into "train" and "weights" folders. If you want to test more time HLC, make sure to restore these initial weights every time: in the "weights" folder you will need to have: actor_params.pt taken from the initWeights folder.
- Transfer the saved weights from the "saved_models" folder of "FetchPickAndPlace-DDPG+HER" of LSE training into the "HLC" folder (replace the folder if asked). Take the 3 files: approach.pt, manipulate.pt and retract.pt stored inside "saved_models/FetchPickAndPlace-v1" and transfer them inside the "weights" folder of HLC. So now in the weights folder you should have: `actor_params.pt`,`approach.pt`,`manipulate.pt`,`retract.pt`.

- In the "HLC" folder you can choose different methods to train HLC: `dense_rewardHandEng`,`sparse_rewardHandEng`,`dense_reward_BC`,`sparse_reward_BC`, `dense_rewardDDPG_HER`,`sparse_rewardDDPG_HER`
 
Dense/sparse reward HandEng it's the training of an agent that has to learn how to choreograph hand engineering actions. Dense/Sparse reward BC it's the training of an agent that has to learn how to choreograph low-level behaviors trained with BC and similar for DDPG+HER.

To train HLC with one of these methods just copy the name and past it in `main.py` file at line 17 
```python=17
from dense_rewardDDPG_HER import train, test
```
The success rate of HLC is on 50 attemps.

- Run the program:
```
python main.py
```


## Results:

### LSE training:
The figure presented here below depicts the sample-efficiency of DDPG+HER, BC and a end-to-end learning method for learning the subtasks.The peak represents the maximum success reached by each method for each subtask, i.e. first peak denotes the completion of training of the approach module, the second peak denotes completion of  training  of  the manipulate  module  and the third  peak  denotes  training of  retract module.
DDPG+HER outperforms BC and reaches 100% success in 218k steps, while BC takes 372k steps. Moreover, DDPG+HER shows a smooth monotonous learning curve compared to BC which does not stabilise immediately after reaching high success values. Overall, DDPG+HER shows less variance compared to BC.
