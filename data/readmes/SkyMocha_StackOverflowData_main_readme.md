# StackOverflow Data Analysis
### Description
This is a simple program analyzing the results of the 2021 stack overflow developer survey. It primarily targets the % and population of trans-identifying programmers in the United States. 

This is done for a YouTube video on the [SkyMocha YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SkyMocha64).

Also for the paper [Why The Trans Programmer?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01553)
