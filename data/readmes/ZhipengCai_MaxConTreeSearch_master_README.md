Consensus maximization is an effective tool for robust fitting in computer vision. A* Tree Search is one of the most efficient methods for globally optimal consensus maximization. In this work, we propose two new techniques that significantly accelerate A* Tree Search, making it capable of handling problems with much larger number of outliers.

Getting Started
===============

This demo is implemented using MATLAB 2018b and has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. 

-------------
Run the demo
-------------

1. Clone this repository. 

2. Run "demo.m" in MATLAB.

Please refer to "demo.m" file for detailed code explanations.

List of addressed problems in the demo
-----------------------------------------

Linear problem:

1. Linearized Fundamental matrix estimation (ignoring the rank-2 constraint)

Nonlinear problem (the code of this part can handle problems with pseudo-convex residuals (see the example forms in the paper) ):

2. Homography estimation

2. [A* tree search + True Outlier Detection (TOD) for branch pruning (Chin et al. TPAMI'17)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7755788)

Variants with our new techniques:

3. A* tree search + Non-Adjacent Path Avoidance (NAPA)

4. A* tree search + NAPA + TOD

5. A* tree search + NAPA + Dimension-Insensitive Branch Pruning (DIBP)
