# Internal Tides CMS

Calculation of Internal Tides (IT) using a Coupled-Mode System (CMS) obtained
by the body-forcing formulation of the hydrodynamic problem.

The function ITCMS calculates the IT generated by a Gaussian ridge.
It returns the energy conversion rate and visualises several flow fields.

Details on the mathematical formulation and the numerical scheme are given in the paper:

# Working Example
Running the [ITCMS.m](https://github.com/chpapoutsellis/InternalTidesCMS/blob/main/ITCMS.m) function in the Matlab Command Window (type ITCMS and press Enter) produces the IT corresponding to the $M_2$ tidal constituent with constant stratification $N=0.0015$ (1/s), Coriolis frequency $f = 0.0001$ (1/s). The amplitude of the horizontal barotropic current at infinity is $U_0 = 0.04$ (m/s). The depth at infinity is $3000$ m and the ridge has a criticality $0.8$ and relative height $0.5$. The calculated energy conversion rate is $1577.26$ (W/m) per unit ridge length. We give below typical plots (baroclinic stream function and horizontal velocity) and a video produced by the code:
