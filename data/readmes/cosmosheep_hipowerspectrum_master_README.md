### This is a repository of public available data and codes we use in [Long et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07615.pdf). 

---
- **fmass_mean.csv & fmass_mean-nv.csv** - filtering mass data with and without streaming velocity effects, $3.5\leq z_{obs}\leq 5.5$, $6\leq z_{re}\leq12$. 
- **analyze_fscale.py** - extracting filtering scales and masses from Gadget2 simulations.
- **bias.py** - calculation of bias coefficients $b_1, b_2, b_{s^2}$ and $b_v$.
- **Makefile.v1 & Makefile.v0** - modified Gadget2 initial condition generation configure files, v1 adds streaming velocity effects.
- **save.c** - modified files in Gadget2 N-GenIC file to enable streaming velocity effect.
