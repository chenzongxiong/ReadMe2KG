# Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (MoChA)

This repository contains a [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/craffel/mocha/blob/master/Demo.ipynb) which shows how to efficiently compute the Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (MoChA) distribution using TensorFlow.
MoChA is described in ["Monotonic Chunkwise Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05382) by Chung-Cheng Chiu\* and Colin Raffel\*, in Proceedings of ICLR 2018.
