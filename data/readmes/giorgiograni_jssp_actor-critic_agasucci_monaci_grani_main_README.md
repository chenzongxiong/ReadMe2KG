## Installation
The neural network models are implemented using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Requirements
The file requirements.txt reports the list of packages that must be installed to run the code. You can add a package to your environment via pip or anaconda using either pip install "package" or conda install "package". The code can be runned either on GPUs or CPUs.

## Configuration and running

In order to test the saved model, you just need to run `main_test.py`. 

Depending on the set of instances you want to test the model on, you have simply to modify the `set_to_test` parameter as follows:

* Taillard benchmark set (insert **'TaiBenchmarkSet**)
* Taillard generated set (insert **'TaiGeneratedSet'**)
* Gaussian Set (insert **'GaussianSet'**)
* Poisson set (insert **'PoissonSet'**)

To generate new sets of instances:

* according to the Taillard method[^1] (insert **'TaillardGenerator'** and modify the related parameters as you prefer)
* according to the Gaussian method (insert **'GaussianGenerator'** and modify the related parameters as you prefer)
* according to the Poisson method (insert **'PoissonGenerator'** and modify the related parameters as you prefer)

## Results

The output of the experiments can be found in folder **Results_TEST/**, where:

**Statistics_`set_to_test`.xlsx** will report the statistics of the experiments performed on the related set of instances.
