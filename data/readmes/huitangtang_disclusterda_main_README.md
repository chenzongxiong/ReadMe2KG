[Project Page](https://huitangtang.github.io/DisClusterDA/) $\cdot$ [PDF Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11984)

The paper is available [here](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1elDO77nKgiag).

## Requirements
- python 3.6.4
- pytorch 1.4.0
- torchvision 0.5.0

## Data preparation
The structure of the used datasets is shown in the folder `./data/datasets/` [here](https://github.com/huitangtang/ViCatDA). 

The original datasets can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/blob/master/data/dataset.md).

## Model training
1. Replace paths and domains in run.sh with those in one's own system. 
2. Install necessary python packages.
3. Run command `sh run.sh`.

The results are saved in the folder `./checkpoints/`.
