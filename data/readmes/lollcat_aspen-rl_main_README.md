# Aspen-RL
Reinforcement learning for chemical engineering process design with Aspen Simulator. 
This is for the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04327) by Stephan C.P.A. van Kalmthout.


Ultimately, we found Aspen simulator to be too slow to be a good option for RL. 
For other work on the topic of RL for chemical engineering process synthesis see the [RL for process design](https://github.com/lollcat/RL-Process-Design) repo and the [Distillation Train Gym](https://github.com/lollcat/DistillationTrain-Gym) repo. 


Our Aspen-Python API (see [here](https://github.com/lollcat/Aspen-RL/blob/main/hydrocarbon_problem/api/aspen_api.py)) may be of interest for those who wish to control Aspen simulations via python code. But be warned - this is not recommended as it is slow.
