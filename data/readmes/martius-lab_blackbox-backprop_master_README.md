## Introduction

This repository contains PyTorch modules that wrap blackbox combinatorial solver via the method proposed in [Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02175).
Besides the solvers employed in the original paper, this repo includes wrapped solvers for ranking (as used in [Blackbox Optimizationof Rank-Based Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03500)) 
and Graph Matching/Multigraph Matching (as used in [Deep Graph Matching via Blackbox Differentiation of Combinatorial Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11657)|).

*Disclaimer*: This code is a PROTOTYPE. It should work fine but use at your own risk.
 
For the exact usage of the combinatorial modules, see our public implementations of
- [Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers](https://github.com/martius-lab/blackbox-differentiation-combinatorial-solvers)
- [Deep Graph Matching via Blackbox Differentiation of Combinatorial Solvers](https://github.com/martius-lab/blackbox-deep-graph-matching).

## Installation

Simply install with pip

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/martius-lab/blackbox-backprop
```

For running the TSP module, a [manual GurobiPy installation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/the_gurobi_python_interfac.html) is required as well as a license

The graph matching and multigraph matching solver and corresponding differentiable PyTorch modules are hosted at the [LPMP repository](https://github.com/LPMP/LPMP) 

## Usage

Exactly as you would expect of a PyTorch module (with minor details differing from solver to solver)
```python
import blackbox_backprop as bb
...
suggested_weights = ResNet18(raw_inputs)
suggested_shortest_paths = bb.ShortestPath(suggested_weights, lambda_val=5.0) # Set the lambda hyperparameter
loss = HammingLoss(suggested_shortest_paths, true_shortest_paths) # Use e.g. Hamming distance as the loss function
loss.backward() # The backward pass is handled automatically
...
```

## Visualizations

Visualizations that have appeared in the papers can be generated in the attached jupyter notebook.
This requires python packages `ipyvolume` and `ipywidgets`. Also, make sure to allow **all jupyter nbextensions** as listed [here](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume).
