## Astronomaly: Protege applied to MGCLS

Repository to host a small website to show the unusual objects discovered by Astronomaly: Protege in the MGCLS data. Viewable at https://michellelochner.github.io/mgcls.protege/.

This repository also hosts some supplementary files from [Lochner & Rudnick (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04188). The catalogue of Protege's recommendations, including source coordinates and human score (where available), is provided in the [catalogue folder](catalogue/README.md), while the outputs from the hyperparameter optimisation experiments in the appendix can be found in the [appendix folder](appendix/README.md). Images of the 6161 source cutouts can be found in the [images folder](images) and in the compressed files `all_images_compressed_part1.zip` and `all_images_compressed_part2.zip`, where the png names correspond to the Protege rank.
