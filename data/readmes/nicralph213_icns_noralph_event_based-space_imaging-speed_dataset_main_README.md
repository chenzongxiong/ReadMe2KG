### Observation file format:

- Each observation session YYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ_speed_survey-DESCRIPTOR 
 - Contains metadata.jsonl for a summary of each observation 
- Each individual observation: YYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ_speed_survey-RA_DEC_SPEED(DEG/S)
- In each individual observation folder: a psee400.es, psee400.mp4 and reddot.jsonl 
 - The event stream file psee400.es can be read and converted using scripts from https://github.com/neuromorphic-paris/command_line_tools 
 - The reddot.jsonl file contains detailed the telescope commands and metadata
