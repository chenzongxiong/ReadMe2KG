This repository contains the code for out of the box ready to use zero-shot classifiers among different tasks, such as Topic Labelling or Relation Extraction. It is built on top of ü§ó HuggingFace [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, so you are free to choose among hundreds of models. You can either, use a dataset specific classifier or define one yourself with just labels descriptions or templates! The repository contains the code for the following publications:

- üìÑ [Ask2Transformers - Zero Shot Domain Labelling with Pretrained Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2021.gwc-1.6/) accepted in [GWC2021](http://globalwordnet.org/global-wordnet-conferences-2/).
- üìÑ [Label Verbalization and Entailment for Effective Zero- and Few-Shot Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.92/) accepted in [EMNLP2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/)

# Models 
## Available models
By default, `roberta-large-mnli` checkpoint is used to perform the inference. You can try different models to perform the zero-shot classification, but they need to be finetuned on a NLI task and be compatible with the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class from Transformers. For example:

* `roberta-large-mnli`
* `joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli`
* `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
* `microsoft/deberta-v2-xlarge-mnli` 

**Coming soon:** `t5-large` like generative models support.

## Pre-trained models üÜï

We now provide (task specific) pre-trained entailment models to: (1) **reproduce** the results of the papers and (2) **reuse** them for new schemas of the same tasks. The models are publicly available on the ü§ó HuggingFace Models Hub.

The model name describes the configuration used for training as follows:

<!-- $$\text{HiTZ/A2T\_[pretrained\_model]\_[NLI\_datasets]\_[finetune\_datasets]}$$ -->

<h3 align="center">HiTZ/A2T_[pretrained_model]_[NLI_datasets]_[finetune_datasets]</h3>


- `pretrained_model`: The checkpoint used for initialization. For example: RoBERTa<sub>large</sub>.
- `NLI_datasets`: The NLI datasets used for pivot training.
    - `S`: Standford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset.
    - `M`: Multi Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset.
    - `F`: Fever-nli dataset.
    - `A`: Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset.
- `finetune_datasets`: The datasets used for fine tuning the entailment model. Note that for more than 1 dataset the training was performed sequentially. For example: ACE-arg.

Some models like `HiTZ/A2T_RoBERTa_SMFA_ACE-arg` have been trained marking some information between square brackets (`'[['` and `']]'`) like the event trigger span. Make sure you follow the same preprocessing in order to obtain the best results.

## Training your own models
There is no special script for fine-tuning your own entailment based models. In our experiments, we have used the publicly available [run_glue.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py) python script (from HuggingFace Transformers). To train your own model, first, you will need to convert your actual dataset in some sort of NLI data, we recommend you to have a look to [tacred2mnli.py](https://github.com/osainz59/Ask2Transformers/blob/master/scripts/tacred2mnli.py) script that serves as an example.

    abstract = "Relation extraction systems require large amounts of labeled examples which are costly to annotate. In this work we reformulate relation extraction as an entailment task, with simple, hand-made, verbalizations of relations produced in less than 15 min per relation. The system relies on a pretrained textual entailment engine which is run as-is (no training examples, zero-shot) or further fine-tuned on labeled examples (few-shot or fully trained). In our experiments on TACRED we attain 63{\%} F1 zero-shot, 69{\%} with 16 examples per relation (17{\%} points better than the best supervised system on the same conditions), and only 4 points short to the state-of-the-art (which uses 20 times more training data). We also show that the performance can be improved significantly with larger entailment models, up to 12 points in zero-shot, allowing to report the best results to date on TACRED when fully trained. The analysis shows that our few-shot systems are specially effective when discriminating between relations, and that the performance difference in low data regimes comes mainly from identifying no-relation cases.",
