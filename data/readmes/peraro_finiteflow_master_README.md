FiniteFlow
==========

A proof-of-concept implementation of the `FiniteFlow` framework.

FiniteFlow is a framework for defining and executing numerical
algorithms over finite fields and reconstructing multivariate rational
functions from numerical evaluations. Within this framework, complex
algorithms are easily defined by combining basic building blocks into
computational graphs, known as dataflow graphs. This allows to easily
implement complex methods over finite fields from high-level languages
and computer algebra systems, without being concerned with the
low-level details of the numerical implementation. Multivariate
analytic results are then reconstructed from these numerical
evaluations. The algorithm sidesteps the appearance of large
intermediate expressions and can be massively parallelized.

It is based on the following publication:

- Tiziano Peraro, *FiniteFlow: multivariate functional reconstruction
  using finite fields and dataflow graphs*,
  [arXiv:1905.08019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08019)

This implementation is written in C++ and includes a Mathematica
interface.  The latter is currently the most usable, complete and
documented way of using this library.


Installation
------------

### Dependencies

#### CMake

FiniteFlow uses the CMake build system, which comes preinstalled on
many systems, or can be installed with available package managers for
most Linux distributions and using Homebrew for macOS.  Binary
installers for several operating systems, as well as additional
information, can be found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/).


#### GMP

GMP is preinstalled on many systems.  A `gmp` package is available on
many Linux distributions and on Homebrew for macOS.  For more
information see [https://gmplib.org/](https://gmplib.org/).


#### FLINT

FiniteFlow uses a few functions and macros from the FLINT library.
For the installation of FLINT you have two options:

- Install the full FLINT library.  Installation packages are available
  for some Linux distrubutions (including Debian/Ubuntu) and macOS.
  See [http://www.flintlib.org/](http://www.flintlib.org/) for more
  information about FLINT and its installation.

- Alternatively, you can install the `flint-finiteflow-dep` library, a
  stripped down version of FLINT which includes the dependencies
  needed by FiniteFlow.  Unlike the full FLINT library, this version
  has no external dependency besides GMP and can therefore be easier
  to install from source (see the README file of
  `flint-finiteflow-dep` for more information).  You can obtain it at
  this [link](https://github.com/peraro/flint-finiteflow-dep).


### Installing FiniteFlow

FiniteFlow uses the CMake build system.  In order to install
FiniteFlow in a default installation path, you can use the command
```
cmake . && make install
```

On Apple Silicon Macs (with M1 processor or newer) add the option `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64` to the `cmake` command.

In order to install FiniteFlow in a custom path, or specify a
different path for its dependencies use
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/installation/path/prefix \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/dependencies/installation/path/prefix \
      -DMATHLIBINSTALL=/mathematica/interface/installation/path .
make install
```
where you can omit any of the options in order to pick a default value
for them.

In order to use FiniteFlow from the Mathematica interface, consider
adding the following to your Mathematica `init.m` file
```
(* the next two lines are only needed if a custom MATHLIBINSTALL path was chosen when running cmake *)
$FiniteFlowLibPath = "/mathematica/interface/installation/path"
If[Not[MemberQ[$LibraryPath,$FiniteFlowLibPath]],$LibraryPath = Flatten[{$LibraryPath, $FiniteFlowLibPath }]];

(* the next two lines are needed to locate FiniteFlow.m, if not already in your $Path *)
$FiniteFlowPath = "/path/to/finiteflow/mathlink"
If[Not[MemberQ[$Path,$FiniteFlowPath]],$Path = Flatten[{$Path, $FiniteFlowPath }]];
```
