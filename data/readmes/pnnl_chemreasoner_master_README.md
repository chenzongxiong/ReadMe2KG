## Installation Instructions

Installation assumes cuda version 12.0

```
mamba env create -f chemreasoner.yml
conda activate chemreasoner
git clone https://github.com/pnnl/chemreasoner.git
cd chemreasoner
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ext/ocp/
pip install -e .
cd ../Open-Catalyst-Dataset
pip install -e .
cd ../..
```

To test the installation:
```
python src/scripts/test_gnn.py      # use --cpu to test on cpu only
```

## Running the ICML Code

The code to reproduce the ICML results is located in ```src/scripts/run_icml_queries.py```. An example run script has been provided in ```src/launch_scripts/run_icml.sh```. You will need to set a few parameters...

* savedir: The directory to save the results in
* start-query: The index of the first query to evaluate (see data/input_data/dataset.csv)
* start-query: The index of the final query to evaluate
* gnn-traj-dir: The directroy in which to store relaxation trajectories
* dotenv-path: The path to .env file containing api keys for your azure openai setup (see instructions below)

### Setting up .env file

The .env file should be located in the chemreasoner root directory and contain the api keys and info for your Azure OpenAI interface, which can be found on the Azure portal.

```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment name>
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<url to deployment endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<api key>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2023-07-01-preview"
```

### Setting up local GNN server

To run relaxations with the GNN model, you will have to set up a redis server. To do so open a new terminal on the same machine that you will be running chemreasoner on (with access to a GPU). Then run,

```
redis-server --dir <directory to store redis server cache>
```

Here, ```--dir``` can be set to any directory.

### Running ICML code

Once you have set up the run script, the .env file, and started the local redis server, run the ICML code by entering

```
./src/launch_scripts/run_icml.sh
```
