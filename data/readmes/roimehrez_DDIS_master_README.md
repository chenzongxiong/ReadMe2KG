## Background

This code implements a fast Template Matching in the wild algorithm.

The algorithm solves the following problem: for each image I and a template T we calculate likelihood map of the template location in the image. We calculate the map using a raster scan over the image. 
DDIS (Deformable Diversity Similarity) used as the similarity measure between each sub window and the template.

## Installation

DDIS mex/C++ code:
We provide rebuild mex functions in the bin folder, 
tested using MATLAB 2016a and VS12 (2013)
If you need to rebuild and compile see Installation.txt inside the DDIS_code folder

### Dependencies:
 
 - TreeCANN: kd tree Coherence Approximate Nearest Neighbor algorithm
            see [[TreeCANN code]](https://github.com/uva-graphics/patchtable/tree/master/patchtable/TreeCANN)
			(provided under utils)
			
### (optional) for deep features
 
 - MatConvNet: see [[MatConvNet code]](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/)
 - imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat should be download from [[vgg]](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat and placed inside folder $\DDIS_code_matlab\utils\deepFeatures).
 - FLANN: we find it hard to recomplie the project, we provide mex files. This is optional
            if L2 between deep features is desirable. Otherwise just use cosine distance.




## Use

To run one pair of images use 
```
DEMOrun.m
```
to run on the entire dataset use 
```
DEMOrunALLData.m
```
core functions:
 - computeDDIS.m - using RGB patches
 - computeDDIS_deep.m - using deep features patches
