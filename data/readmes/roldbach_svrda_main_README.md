> **Abstract** <br>
> **Background and Objective:** The lack of benchmark datasets has impeded the
> advancement of slice-to-volume registration algorithms. Such datasets are
> difficult to annotate primarily due to the dimensional difference within data
> and the dearth of task-specific software. We seek to develop a user-friendly
> tool to streamline dataset annotation for slice-to-volume registration.<br>
>
> **Methods:** The proposed tool namely SVRDA is an installation-free web
> application for platform-independent collaborative dataset annotation. It
> enables efficient transformation manipulation via keyboard shortcuts and
> smooth case transitions with auto-saving. SVRDA also supports configuration-
> based data loading and adheres to the separation of concerns, offering great
> flexibility and extensibility for future research. Various supplementary
> features have been implemented to facilitate slice-to-volume registration.<br>
>
> **Results:** We validated the effectiveness of SVRDA by indirectly evaluating
> the post-registration segmentation quality on the UK Biobank data, observing
> in a dramatic overall improvement (24.02% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient
> and 48.93% in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance respectively) supported
> by highly statistically significant evidence ($p < 0.001$). Also, we showcased
> the clinical usage of SVRDA by integrating it into test-retest T1
> quantification on in-house magnetic resonance acquisitions, leading to more
> consistent results after registration.<br>
>
> **Conclusions:** SVRDA can facilitate collaborative annotation of benchmark
> datasets while being potentially applicable to other pipelines incorporating
> slice-to-volume registration.<br>

        |   |   |-- *<<slice_mask_keyword_2>>*.nii.gz
            `-- |-- ...
    ```
- Please modify the provided [configuration template](./assets/configuration_template.json)
to fit your dataset.
    - For example, if the target dataset looks like the following and is located
    at **/home/sample_dataset**:
        ```
        |-- sample_dataset
            |-- case_1
            |   |-- body
            |   |   |-- body-1.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- body-2.nii.gz
            |   |-- organ
            |   |   |-- organ-1.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- organ-2.nii.gz
            |   |-- slice
            |   |   |-- slice-a.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- slice-b.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- slice-c.nii.gz
            |-- case_2
            |   |-- body
            |   |   |-- body-1.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- body-2.nii.gz
            |   |-- organ
            |   |   |-- organ-1.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- organ-2.nii.gz
            |   |-- slice
            |   |   |-- slice-a.nii.gz
            |   |   |-- slice-b.nii.gz
                `-- |-- slice-c.nii.gz
        ```
    - Then, the corresponding configuration file could be:
        ```

            },
            "tag": {
                "organ_resampled": "-resampled"   # tag used to synthesize file names for 2D
                                                  # resampled segmentation labels
            },
        }
        ```

## Important Features
### Transformation
- **Rigid transformations** with six degrees of freedom (three translation and
three rotation parameters) can be applied to adjust the poses of 2D slices.
- Transformations can be computed with respect to:
    - Patient Coordinate System: A static RAS+ coordinate system
    - Slice Coordinate System: A dynamic coordinate system based on the
    real-time pose of the currently selected slice
- Please control transformations using the following keyboard shortcuts:
    - Translations in the Patient Coordinate System:
        - x axis: **a**, **d**
        - y axis: **w**, **s**
        - z axis: **q**, **e**
    - Translations in the Slice Coordinate System:
        - x axis: **j**, **l**
        - y axis: **i**, **k**
        - z axis: **u**, **o**
    - Rotations in the Slice Coordinate System:
        - x axis: **Shift+W**, **Shift+S**
        - y axis: **Shift+A**, **Shift+D**
        - z axis: **Shift+Q**, **Shift+E**

### Mode
- Modes are introduced to adjust the granularity of transformation control:
    - Macro Mode
        - **All 2D slices** are visible.
        - Transformations are applied to **all 2D slices** simultaneously.
    - Micro Mode
        - Only **the selected 2D slice** is visible.
        - Transformations are exclusively applied to **the selected 2D slice**.

### Alignment Quantification
- The alignment between data is quantitatively monitored in real-time by
measuring the difference between the selected slice and its corresponding 2D
cross-section image resampled from the 3D volume.
- The following evaluation metrics have been implemented:
    - Normalised Mutual Information (NMI): A **similarity** metric that measure
    the ratio of the sum of the marginal entropy between the images.
    - Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD): A **difference** metric that measures
    the sum of the absolute difference between pixel values between the images.

### Case and Saving
- To shift to a new case, please:
    - use **Previous/Next** buttons to go through each case one-by-one.
    - select the new case ID in the dropdown showing the current case ID.
- The current case is **auto-saved** before shifting to a new case.
- **Please notice that directly closing the browser won't save the current case.
To save the last case, please manually press the Save button.**
