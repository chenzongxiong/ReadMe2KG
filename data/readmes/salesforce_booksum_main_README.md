## Introduction
The majority of available text summarization datasets include short-form source documents that lack long-range causal and temporal dependencies, and often contain strong layout and stylistic biases. 
While relevant, such datasets will offer limited challenges for future generations of text summarization systems.
We address these issues by introducing BookSum, a collection of datasets for long-form narrative summarization.
Our dataset covers source documents from the literature domain, such as novels, plays and stories, and includes highly abstractive, human written summaries on three levels of granularity of increasing difficulty: paragraph-, chapter-, and book-level.
The domain and structure of our dataset poses a unique set of challenges for summarization systems, which include: processing very long documents, non-trivial causal and temporal dependencies, and rich discourse structures.
To facilitate future work, we trained and evaluated multiple extractive and abstractive summarization models as baselines for our dataset.

## Usage

#### 1. Chapterized Project Guteberg Data
The chapterized book text from Gutenberg, for the books we use in our work, has been made available through a public GCP bucket. It can be fetched using:
```
gsutil cp gs://sfr-books-dataset-chapters-research/all_chapterized_books.zip .
```

or downloaded directly [here](https://storage.cloud.google.com/sfr-books-dataset-chapters-research/all_chapterized_books.zip).

#### 2. Data Collection
Data collection scripts for the summary text are organized by the different sources that we use summaries from.
Note: At the time of collecting the data, all links in literature_links.tsv were working for the respective sources. 

For each data source, the file `literature_links.tsv.pruned` contains the links for the books in our dataset. Run `get_summaries.py` to collect the summaries from the links for each source. Additionally, `get_works.py` can be used to collect an exhaustive set of summaries from that source.

```
cd scripts/data_collection/cliffnotes/
python get_summaries.py
```

#### 3. Data Cleaning


1. Perform basic cleanup operations and setup the summary text for splitting and further cleaning operations
    ```
    cd scripts/data_cleaning_scripts/
    python basic_clean.py
    ```

2. Using a mapping of which chapter summaries are separable (`alignments/chapter_summary_aligned.jsonl.aggregate_splits`), the summary text is split into different sections (eg. Chapters 1-3 summary separated into 3 different sections - Chapter 1 summary, Chapter 2 summary, Chapter 3 summary)
    ```
    python split_aggregate_chaps_all_sources.py
    ```

3. The main cleanup script separates out analysis/commentary/notes from the summary text, removes prefixes etc.
    ```
    python clean_summaries.py
    ```

#### Data Alignments
Generating paragraph alignments from the chapter-level-summary-alignments, is performed individually for the train/test/val splits:

Gather the data from the summaries and book chapters into a single jsonl. The script needs to be run separately for each split as the matched file
```
cd paragraph-level-summary-alignments
python gather_data.py --matched_file /path/to/chapter_summary_aligned_{train/test/val}_split.jsonl --split_paragraphs
```

Generate alignments of the paragraphs with sentences from the summary using the bi-encoder **paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1**
```
python align_data_bi_encoder_paraphrase.py --data_path /path/to/chapter_summary_aligned_{train/test/val}_split.jsonl.gathered --stable_alignment
```

## Troubleshooting
1. The web archive links we collect the summaries from can often be unreliable, taking a long time to load. One way to fix this is to use higher sleep timeouts when one of the links throws an exception, which has been implemented in some of the scripts.
2. Some links that constantly throw errors are aggregated in a file called - 'section_errors.txt'. This is useful to inspect which links are actually unavailable and re-running the data collection scripts for those specific links.
3. Some paths in the provided files might throw errors depending on where the chapterized books have been downloaded. It is recommended to download them in booksum root directory for the scripts to work without requiring any modifications to the paths.
