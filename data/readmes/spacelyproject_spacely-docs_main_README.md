# Welcome to the Spacely Project

Spacely is an open-source framework for the post-silicon validation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) which maximizes the reuse of hardware and software, reducing the time taken to achieve meaningful test results. Spacely specifically addresses the needs of small, flexible ASIC design teams commonly found in academia or research institutions.

Spacely was originally developed at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 

## Explore the Spacely Project

Spacely includes software, firmware, and hardware components distributed across several repositories:

* **spacely-docs:** This repository is the right place to start! View documentation about using Spacely.
* **spacely:** Core spacely Python code.
* **py-libs-common:** Shared low-level python libraries.
* **spacely-caribou-common-blocks:** Common firmware blocks for use with a Spacely-Caribou flow.
