##1. What is EDA suite##
EDA suite is a tool I use for my research at the University of Mainz, Germany.
It is meant as a tool to test different probabilistic models in the 
context of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) (see [1]).

It comprises
* a main EDA file (eda.m) with the basic loop
* a set of benchmark problems (fitnessXXX.m)
* a number of probabilistic models, currently:
 * a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [2]
 * the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) [3]
 * Population-based incremental learning  (PBIL) [4]
 * Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) [5]
 * Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) [6]; (includes some code written by R. Salakhutdinov)
 * Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [7]
 * Factored Higher-Order RBM [8]
* some basic selection functions
 
##2. How can I use it?##
 * I used GNU/Octave for all experiments, mostly v3.2.4 and 3.8.1
   (you might need to install some extra packages, especially for BOA) 
 * Start Octave, go to the ./src/ directory
 * adjust the EDA parameters (including the choice of problem)
    in the file set_eda_params.m
 * adjust the selection parameters in the file set_selection_params.m
 * choose a model which you want to use, and change the appropriate 
   .m-file, e.g. set_rbm_params.m
 * load all settings into the ocatave-workspace, and start the EDA,
   as follows:

```
set_eda_params;
set_selection_params;
set_ae_params;  %in case you want to use the denoising autoencoder
[mean_fitness, best_fitness, found_in_iteration,cputime_until_best]=eda(eda_params,selection_params,model_params)
```
##3. Publications and configurations
The following publications include experiments performed with this code (see individual comments).

The corresponding configuration files can be found in the directory '.configs-papers/'
