# CARP

CARP (Compression through Adaptive Recursive Partitioning for Multi-dimensional Image Data) is a 
command-line software program written in MATLAB/C++ and designed to
compress multi-dimensional images (2D images, 3D volumes, videos, etc.). 





## toy_example.m

Run CARP package on a toy image: stripe flag.

### Step 1: Install Amadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html) on your machine.

### Step 2: Run 'mex_this.m' in the folder 'source_3D_matlab_mac'.

### Step 3: Run 'toy_example.m'.


```
Usage: run toy_example.m
Input: stripe flag image
Adjustable parameter: sigma_hat
Output: compression ratio; reconstruction of image
```
