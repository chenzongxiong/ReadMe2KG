Supplementary Information for the paper Meyer, H., Pebesma, E. (accepted): "Predicting into unknown space? Estimating the area of applicability of spatial prediction models".
Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

* The case study described in the paper can be reproduced using the "CaseStudy.Rmd" in the src folder. 
Some results using different case study settings can be found in figures/caseStudyExamples.

* "Concept_figures.Rmd" creates the conceptual figures used in the paper as well as additional figures to explain the methodology. 

* "CaseStudyScenarios.R" was used to compare the DI and AOA for different scenarios of response variable, sample size and random seed. 
The script was run on a HPC system. The results are stored in "data/".
"CaseStudyScenarios_figures.R" can be used to analyse the result of the different scenarios and create the figures used in the paper.
