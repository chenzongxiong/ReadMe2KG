# Quantum-inspired annealing for material searching
- Codes for our paper "Tackling the challenge of a huge materials science search space with quantum-inspired annealing"
- http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03023

# Usage
You can run jupyter notebook codes for the demo codes
 
# Note
- In the paper, Fujitsu digital annealer is used for annealing.
- The annealer is not open for public. Therefore, an CPU-based module, Blueqat is used in the demos instead.
