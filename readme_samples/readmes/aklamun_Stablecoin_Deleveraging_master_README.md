# Modeling Non-custodial Stablecoins
Resources from paper "(In)Stability for the Blockchain: Deleveraging Spirals and Stablecoin Attacks"

To be published in Cryptoeconomics Systems journal, MIT Press
Presented at Crypto Valley Conference 2019, European Central Bank P2P Financial Systems 2019, and Crypto Economics Security Conference 2019


Paper available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02152),
Devcon V talk available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOi50UtxL7A),
DeFi Summit talk (longer version) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpsHA_5Lr4)


This repository contains
- Simulator code for the paper
- Presentation slides
- A supplementary short paper discussing design considerations and analyzing attack vectors. Contributes numerical examples of profitable bets on liquidations within the model.

There are also two follow-up papers
- "While Stability Lasts" [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01304), containing an improved model and stronger results. Corresponding blog post [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/insights-from-modeling-stablecoins-a30e732aef1b)
- "Stablecoins 2.0" [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12388), which maps out the wider stablecoin design space and develops models for addressing governance extractable value (GEV) and miner extractable value (MEV). Corresponding blog posts [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/stablecoins-2-0-economic-foundations-for-defi-b9ab38500b87) and [here](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/our-network-deep-dive-2)
