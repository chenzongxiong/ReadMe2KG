# Learning to navigate image manifolds induced by generative adversarial networks for unsupervised video generation

Code for reproducing the experiments reported on [our preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11384) that proposes a two-step framework for generative modeling of temporal data.

## Tested with

- Python 3.6
- Pytorch > 0.4.1

## Pending:
- Upload pre-trained models
- Improve documentation
