# BS-IDT_Data
The data are for the paper **“Bond-Selective Intensity Diffraction Tomography”**. The preprint of this paper can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13630. All the data are 32-bit tif-format images. They are reconstructed imaging results for Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure S1. These files can be directly opened by [Fiji ImageJ](https://fiji.sc/). Displayed items in Figures 3, 4, 5, and S1 can be recovered using these imaging data. Please locate the corresponding image by checking the file name. For example, **“Figure3_BladderCancerCell_Chemical_IRoff.tif”** stands for the reconstruction data of bladder cancer cell samples under the experimental condition of **“IRoff”** used for Figure 3 in the paper.
