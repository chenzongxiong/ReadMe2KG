# Automated OCTA segmentation
This repository contains the code that has been used in the study described [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09978). 
We proposed for the first time an extensive comparison of blood vessel segmentation methods in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).
Each folder represents a vessel enhancement method (Frangi, Gabor, SCIRD-TS, OOF, CNN, and UNet), plus measuremnets to compute quality of teh segmentation (CAL, TopS). CS-Net implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/suyanzhou626/CSNet) 
Folders contain README.md when necessary or comments to guide you through the code.  

## Data
[Link](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2729)
 
## Programming languages
The code contains scripts in matlab and python (jupyter notebook). 

### Versions
 **Matlab:** MATLAB R2018b
 
 **Python:** 3.6.9 (tensorflow-gpu = 1.10.0, tensorflow = 1.12.0)


## Filter requirements
Implementations of Frangi, Gabor, SCIRD-TS, OOF have been already provided somewhere else. Info can be found in each folder.
