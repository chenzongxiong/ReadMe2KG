## Abstract
<div align="center"><h4>G3Reg is a fast and robust global registration framework for point clouds.</h4></div>

<div align = "center"><img src="assets/pipeline.png" width="95%" /> </div>

**Features**:
+ **Fast matching**: We utilize segments, including planes, clusters, and lines, parameterized as Gaussian Ellipsoid Models (GEM) to facilitate registration.
+ **Robustness**: We introduce a distrust-and-verify scheme, termed Pyramid Compatibility Graph for Global Registration (PAGOR), designed to enhance the robustness of the registration process.
+ **Framework Integration**: Both GEM and PAGOR can be integrated into existing registration frameworks to boost their performance. 

**Note to Practitioners**:
+ **Application Scope**: The method outlined in this paper focuses on global registration of outdoor LiDAR point clouds. However, the fundamental principles of G3Reg, including segment-based matching and PAGOR, are applicable to any point-based registration tasks, including indoor environments.
+ **Segmentation Check**: If the registration does not perform as expected on your point cloud, it is advisable to review the segmentation results closely, referring to [Segmentation Demo](docs/demo.md).
+ **Alternative Matching Approaches**: For practitioners preferring not to use GEM-based matching, point-based matching is a viable alternative. For implementation details, please refer to the configuration file at [fpfh_pagor](configs/kitti_lc_bm/fpfh_pagor.yaml).
+ **Limitations**: Segment-based matching may be less effective in environments with sparse geometric information, such as areas with dense vegetation. In such scenarios, enhancing segment descriptions through hand-crafted or deep learning-based descriptors is recommended to improve matching accuracy.
