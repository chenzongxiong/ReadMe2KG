Our results on real data:

## SPMCS Dataset
We have release the testing set of SPMCS. [download](https://tinyurl.com/y426dcn9)

It consists `30` different videos, each of them contains `31` frames.

Each sequence contains bicubic downsampled input for `x2`, `x3`, `x4` scale factors. Folder `truth` contains high-resolution ground truth image for calculating PSNR and SSIM.

Since many previous methods use `31` frames to produce one result for central frame, we also evaluate quantative result only for the central frame (the number in our paper). We do not crop boundary or use other postprocessing. 

We evaluete PSNR and SSIM only for Y channel of YUV color space. 

## Code v0.1
Currently, we release our research code for testing.
It should produce the same results as in the paper for scale factor `x2` & `x4` and frame number `3`.

### Testing
It would be very easy to understand the `test()` function and test on your own data.

### Training
We will update the code for training and better reading after recent deadline.

## Video Results
Here we provide video results for `15` sequences for visual and quantitative comparisons.
