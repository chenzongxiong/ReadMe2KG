# Clarkson Fingerprint Generator

Official Repository for Clarkson Fingerprint GAN models.

CFG-V2 is coming soon.
The TF2 version of the codes will be released soon.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10403


## Fingerprint Generator

You can try our Fingerprint Generator in Google Collab ! 


## As Colab is not supporting TF1 anymore, we moved the colab code to Pytorch. CFG_V2 will be released soon.

## 50K Synthetically Generated Fingerprints (TF version)

You can donwlad 50K of our synthetic fingerprints:
