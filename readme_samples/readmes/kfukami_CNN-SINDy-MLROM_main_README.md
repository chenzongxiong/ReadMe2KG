# CNN-SINDy-MLROM
Sample codes of CNN-SINDy based reduced-order modeling for fluid flows.  
The present model can derive a governing equation of low-dimensionalizaed manifolds of fluid flows extracted via convolutional neural network-based autoencoder.

This repository contains a sample notebook of SINDy for AE-based latent variables with a periodic cylinder wake.
Authors provide no guarantees for this code. Use as-is and for academic research use only; no commercial use allowed without permission. The code is written for educational clarity and not for speed.
Since this is a sample notebook, we also do not provide a data set and CNN-AE. For the data set and CNN-AE, please refer to our previous papars with [their sample codes](https://sites.google.com/view/kai-fukami/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0/let-us-machine-learn?authuser=0) as follows:
