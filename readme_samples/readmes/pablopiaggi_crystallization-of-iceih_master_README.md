This repository contains the input files to reproduce the results of the paper mentioned above. 

Brief summary of the contents of each folder:
* ```Environments``` : This folder has the reference environments that will be used for the definition of the CV
* ```Equilibration``` : Input and output files for the equilibration of liquid water and ice Ih. Distributions of the kernel and equilibrium box sizes for production runs.
* ```BiasedSimulations``` : Input and output files for the biased simulations (production runs).

Most of the analysis of the simulations is described in a Jupyter Notebook in ```BiasedSimulations/Analysis.ipynb```.
