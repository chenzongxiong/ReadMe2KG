## Usage

```
# tensorflow version, when L=7
import tensorflow as tf
from layers.atnconv import AtnConv
cnum = 32
x = conv2d(input, cnum//2, ksize=3, stride=1)

# encode
enc_feats = []
dims = [cnum * i for i in [1, 2, 4, 8, 8, 8]]
for i in range(len(dims)):
  enc_feats.append(x)
  x = conv2d(x, dims[i], ksize=3, stride=2)
latent_feat = x

# attention transfer networks
attn_feats = []
x = latent_feat
for i in range(len(dims)):
  x = AtnConv(enc_feats[-(i+1)], x, mask)
  attn_feats.append(x)

# decode
x = latent_feat
dims = [cnum * i for i in [1./2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 8]]
for i in range(len(dims)):
  x = deconv2d(x, dims[-(i+1)], ksize=3, stride=2)
  x = tf.concat([x, attn_feats[i]], axis=3)

output = conv2d(x, 3, ksize=1, stride=1)
