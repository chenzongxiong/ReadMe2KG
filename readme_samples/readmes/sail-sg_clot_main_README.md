This repository is the official codebase of "Let's Think Outside the Box: Exploring Leap-of-Thought in Large Language Models with Creative Humor Generation" [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02439). Our paper has been accepted at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2024 (CVPR 2024).

## ðŸ¤£ Introduction

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to profoundly explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) ability in multimodal large language models (LLMs). This involves challenging LLMs to **think outside the box**, a non-sequential thinking skill equally crucial alongside popular sequential thinking abilities, such as Chain-of-Thought based methods. In this study, we delve into the LLM's LoT ability through the lens of a humor generation game called Oogiri (å¤§å–œåˆ©). The Oogiri game serves as an ideal platform for exploring the LLM's LoT ability, as it compels participants to think outside the box and provide unexpected and humorous responses to multimodal information (including I2T, T2T, and IT2T).

## ðŸ¤— Quickstart

We provide a simple Chinese example in `inference.py` for using CLoT with zero-shot inference. Before you start, make sure you install the following packages:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the command below:

```shell
python inference.py
```

## ðŸ’¬ Gradio Web UI

Try launching the Gradio web interface with the following code!

```shell
python gradio_demo.py
```
